You should choose the one you like the most and are most comfortable with. Your
major won’t affect this much. If there is software you need for a class, it is
likely you’ll run it through VLab.

If you are a CS major, I would strongly recommend you use a distribution of
Linux (start with Ubuntu if it’s your first time). You’ll have a Unix terminal,
and getting software you need for classes will be a lot easier. And when you get
your first internship or job, your company will probably work on Linux
computers--it’s a great skill to have, in my experience.

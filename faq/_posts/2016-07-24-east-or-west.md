The East/West campus divide is a notable part of the Freshman experience because friend groups often form in frequented cafeterias, which are found on each side of campus. The two sides of campus are about 1 mile apart, so going across campus for socializing can be difficult. While I, living on East, could nearly always find friends to sit with when walking into an East Campus dining hall, I usually only recognized a couple kids I had never talked to when I have gone to Woodies alone. All of the 2-bed Freshman dorms are about the same size, although some of the ‘nicer’ dorms are a couple dozen square feet larger. Even if you end up not being able to choose which side of campus you live on, this list tell you what you’re getting into.

East
----

+ Generally considered the more “social/party” side.
+ Closer to Greek houses (fraternities and sororities).
+ Brittain Dining Hall and North Avenue are better than Woodies.
+ Small gym in the Glenn/Towers connector (only treadmills and bikes).
+ Peter's Parking deck has Basketball and Tennis courts.
+ Closer to Tech Square, Midtown Atlanta, MARTA stations.
+ Generally has more students walking around late at night, so it can often feel safer.


West
----

+ Generally considered the more “quiet” side.
+ New dining hall being built might be nice.
+ Closer to the CRC (Campus Recreation Center) and intramural fields.
+ Closer to Burger Bowl (large park) and Sand Volleyball
+ Its outdoor basketball courts are more used than the ones on East.
+ Closer to restaurants like Wingzone, Rocky Mountain Pizza, etc.

I usually advise freshmen to try and live on East. I’ve heard many times “I wish I’d lived on East my first year.” I’ve never heard the opposite. Both sides have pros and cons, and it depends on what your priorities are.

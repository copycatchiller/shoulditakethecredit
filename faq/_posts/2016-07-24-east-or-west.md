!!! East

+ Generally considered the more “social/party” side.
+ Closer to Greek houses (fraternities and sororities).
+ Brittain Dining Hall and North Avenue are much better than Woodies.
+ Small gym in the Glenn/Towers connector (only treadmills and bikes).
+ Closer to Tech Square, Midtown Atlanta, MARTA stations.

!!! West

+ Generally considered the more “quiet” side.
+ Nicer dorms with more spacious rooms.
+ Closer to the CRC (Campus Recreation Center).
+ Closer to restaurants like Wingzone, Rocky Mountain Pizza, etc.

I usually advise freshmen to try and live on East. I’ve heard many times “I wish I’d lived on East my first year.” I’ve never heard the opposite. Both sides have pros and cons, and it depends on what your priorities are.

These are some of my favorite date restaurants close to campus:



~~**North Avenue Dining Hall**~~

~~Excellent first date spot. Second date or your money back.~~  





**Cafe Intermezzo**

Coffeehouse and restaurant in Midtown.  





**FIGO Pasta**

Cozy, casual place close to West Campus.  





**Mary Mac's**

Southern comfort food.  





**Sean's Harvest Market**

Get some food to go and find a quiet spot to sit on Piedmont Park.  





**Ecco**

A little more expensive than the rest but the food is really good and it has a fun atmosphere.

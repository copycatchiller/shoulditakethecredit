These are some of my favorite date restaurants close to campus:

<br>



~~**North Avenue Dining Hall**~~

~~Excellent first date spot. Second date or your money back.~~  

<br>



**Cafe Intermezzo**

Coffeehouse and restaurant in Midtown.  

<br>



**FIGO Pasta**

Cozy, casual place close to West Campus.  

<br>



**Mary Mac's**

Southern comfort food.  

<br>



**Sean's Harvest Market**

Get some food to go and find a quiet spot to sit on Piedmont Park.  

<br>



**Ecco**

A little more expensive than the rest but the food is really good and it has a fun atmosphere.

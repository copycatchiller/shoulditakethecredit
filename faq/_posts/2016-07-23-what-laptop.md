Georgia Tech lists its official hardware requirements [online][0]. 

From personal experience, I suggest a laptop that is 13-15 inches, with a
smallish form factor. Keep in mind this is something that you will be carrying
around all day, to most or all of your courses. Other important things to keep
in mind are battery life, while many classrooms have outlets, not all do. 

Brands are not super important. Macbooks, Dell XPS ultrabooks, Lenovo and Yogas,
and Microsoft Surfaces are good places to start if you are not worrying about
budget. Lenovo Thinkpads and Dell Latitudes and Inspirons are a good place to
start. Be aware of vendor bloat and such. I always suggest clean-installing the
OS. And be aware of things like [Superfish][1] that occured with Lenovo (which
is to say, they make good hardware, but be aware that they might be spying on
you).

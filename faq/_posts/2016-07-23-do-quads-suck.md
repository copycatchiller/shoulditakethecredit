No! Quads are lit. A lot of my friends were in quads and they loved it. Yes, you’ll have less privacy, but you’ll have 3 people to hang out with from the start. Quads are a lot bigger and give you more flexibility to arrange furniture. You can put two beds in each room, or have all four in one room and a hangout/study in the other.

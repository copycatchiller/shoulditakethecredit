[Parking & Transportation Service's website has all the info on this.](https://pts.gatech.edu/transit)

Here's some stuff you might use:

Tech Trolley – goes to Midtown Marta station, Publix, Tech Square, and around north/west sides of campus

Red and Blue Buses – circles campus, visit West campus dorms, North Ave
apartments. These are nearly the same routes just going in different directions.
This is just kind of getting on the bus and riding to get the hang out it. The
GT buses app is good because it has the bus stops, so you can see where the bus
is and how long it will be till it gets to a stop. The Trolley is also on the
app.


Green Route – Goes around Home Park, stops at student competition center and off-campus research buildings

Midnight Rambler – trolley that runs at night, 9pm-3am. Goes to west and east
campus dorms and stops at the Clough building unlike the Regular trolley.

Tech Square Express - Runs directly back and forth between the Clough building and Tech Square

Stingerette – runs from 6pm-6am. You go online stingerette.com or call
404-385-7433. Tell them where you are and where you want to go and they come
pick you up. Great for late night studying when you’re ready to go home

GT Buses App: Available for free on the App Store, and allows students to track buses in realtime and see estimated predictions of arrival times at each stop

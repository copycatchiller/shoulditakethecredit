[Parking & Transportation Service's website has all the info on this.](https://pts.gatech.edu/transit)

Here's some stuff you might use:

Tech Trolley – goes to Midtown Marta station, Publix, Tech Square

Red and Blue Buses – circles campus, visit West campus dorms, North Ave
apartments. These are nearly the same routes just going in different directions.
This is just kind of getting on the bus and riding to get the hang out it. The
GT buses app is good because it has the bus stops, so you can see where the bus
is and how long it will be till it gets to a stop. The Trolley is also on the
app.


Green Route – Goes through Home Park, don't take it if you live on campus

Midnight Rambler – trolley that runs at night, 9pm-3am. Goes to west and east
campus dorms unlike the Regular trolley.

Stingerette – runs from 6pm-6am. You go online stingerette.com or call
404-385-7433. Tell them where you are and where you want to go and they come
pick you up. Great for late night studying when you’re ready to go home

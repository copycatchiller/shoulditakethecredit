Buzzfunds are Tech's form of digital currency. They are the only way to pay for
laundry, and can be used at a number of places around campus, including the
dining halls and restaurants, vending machines, Barnes and Noble, and various
other campus institutions. I rarely use my credit card or cash on campus, and
opt to instead only use Buzzfunds and Dining Dollars.

Buzzfunds, unlike Dining Dollars, don't expire at the end of the school year.

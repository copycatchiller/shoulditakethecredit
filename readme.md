Should I Take The Credit
========================

An FAQ and resources website for incoming Georgia Tech students, managed by GT
students, faculty, and anyone else who wants to help. Consider this a
lightweight unofficial wiki, hosted on github, and curated via pull request.

### Contributing
If you use Unix, we assume you know git. Clone this repository, make a
branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

If you use windows, [download github for windows][1], and create a github
account. Then, clone this repository, create a branch, and make your changes.
Commit them and create a pull request. The application guides you quite well.
Or, if you are feeling adventureous, learn git! Its a cool tool, and a great
way to confuse yourself for a weekend or two.

This site uses [jekyll][2] as its static content generator. This means that
posts are formatted in markdown with a special yaml "frontmatter". For the most
part, the format is very straightforward, please reach out to a maintainer if
you have any questions. We welcome contributions.

If what we just said makes no sense to you, you can contribute by submitting your contribution [here][3] and adding the "contribution" label.

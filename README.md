# Hyde

This repository holds our forked version of the popular Hyde theme for Jekyll
([original readme](./README-original.md)).

We've added a search box in the sidebar that provides instant search on all your
posts and pages (provided that you've indexed them with our [Jekyll plugin][1]).

We've imported the content of [our blog](https://blog.algolia.com/), and made
a [demo available online](http://algolia.github.io/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/)
so you can test it.

## Maintenance

We'll strive to keep this repository up to date with any update done to the
original Hyde theme.

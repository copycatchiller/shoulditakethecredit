You Buzzcard is incredibly important. It takes the role of ID, key, and credit
card on campus. 

Buildings on campus are secured with electric locks and your
buzzcard will grant access to your dorm, major specific buildings, and common
buildings when they would otherwise be locked. 

As an ID, you can use your buzzcard for student discounts internationally
(seriously, I've gotten discounts on museums everywhere from California to
France), and to get in to various on campus events (including home games).

Your buzzcard also contains freshman meal swipes, dining credits, and buzzfunds.
And these are what you will probably use to pay for most of the things you eat
and purchase on campus.

Georgia Tech lists its official hardware requirements [online][0].

Choose the operating system you are most comfortable with.

We suggest a laptop that is 13-15 inches, with a
smallish form factor. Keep in mind this is something that you will be carrying
around all day to most or all of your courses. You should keep in mind battery life: a lot of classrooms have plugs near every seat, but not all of them.

Macbooks, Dell XPSs, Dell Inspirons, Lenovo Thinkpads, and Lenovo Yogas are all good picks. Be aware of vendor bloat and such. We suggest you do a clean OS install as soon as you get your laptop.

Using OSCAR. You'll log into OSCAR (oscar.gatech.edu), then navigate to Student
Services, then Registration, then choose "Add or Drop Classes", and enter the
CRNs (Course Registration Numbers) for the courses you plan to enroll in an
submit. There will likely be errors and conflicts and problems, and you fix
them.

NOTE: you don't actually register with courseoff, you register with OSCAR.

The tool most people use to create a schedule is [courseoff](courseoff.com). It
will update with courses for the upcoming semester a few months before the
semester begins, at which point you will be able to use it to create potential
schedules. 

There are a number of things to consider when making a schedule. These mainly
come down to overall load and time of day. Here's some big ones:

 - 4 hour lab courses (PHYS, CHEM, EAS, BIOL) have a lab component and a lecture
   component. The lab component is named something like E3, whereas the lecture
   will be E. Lectures are 1 hour M/W/F, and labs will usually be a single 3
   hour block one day. You need both to register.
 - You should leave time to have lunch, every day. Nothing is more miserable
   than being hungry during the English class that you don't really want to
   attend in the first place.
 - Taking 8AM courses is fine if you are a morning person. I was not. I rarely
   made it to my 10AM courses. College doesn't coddle you, and there often isn't
   an immediate punishment for missing lectures. You only realize that there is
   a problem when you fail an exam.
 - We all want to believe that we will study during the holes in our
   swiss-cheese looking schedule. Empirically, that's rare. Keep that in mind
   when there are 1 hour holes throughout your schedule. You probably will not
   make significant progress on your homework during those periods.
 - Classes are difficult. Generally speaking, don't take more than 16 hours your
   first semester. Its much better to have an easy semester than to start with a
   low GPA or a dropped course (There are exceptions to this, often having to do
   with HOPE and financials).
 - Ask upperclassmen. A lot of use will be able to answer you questions, and
   often have more information than advisors (the College of Computing advisors
   would often ask me to help students make their schedules because I had
   firsthand knowledge of professors and individual situaions). There are times
   when advisors can be very useful, but feedback on your specific schedule is
   probably not one of them, and they have enough on their plates.

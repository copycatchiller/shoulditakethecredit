That depends on a lot. Obviously, there are some classes that most new students
will need to take, an English (ENGL 1101 or 1102), a math (MATH 1551, 1552,
1553, 1554, 1564, 2550, or 2551 depending on things), and a Computer Science (CS
1301, 1315, 1331, or 1371 depending on your major) are good courses to start
looking at. Some people also want to take various gen ed requirements like ECON,
INTA 1101, POL, HIST, or foreign language courses.

Other courses depend on major, the first semester for a ME or AE major will look
different than a CS major, and both will look different than a CHEM, INTA, or
ARCH major. Keep in mind that you will have a chance to meet with an adviser at
FASET, either an employee or a FASET leader in your major. They will help you
1-on-1 and giver personalized suggestions.

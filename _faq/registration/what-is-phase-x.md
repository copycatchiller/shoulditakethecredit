Registration is divided into phase 1 and phase 2. For returning students, phase
one registration occurs a semester in advance. So for Fall 2016, returning
students registered for classes in Spring 2016. Phase two happens the first week
of the semester, so phase two for Fall 2016 is sometime in August 2016.

Obviously, new students can't register during the previous semester, as a
result, for incoming students, Phase one takes place during FASET for those who
attend a FASET session, or at a random point prior to the start of the semester
(you can look up your time ticket on OSCAR). 

During phase 1, you may not be able to register for courses for a variety of
reasons. However in phase 2 most of these registration blocks are removed.

One of the big experiences of starting college life is handling allll that laundry. Here's a quick guide on how to get it done:

1. Ask your PL where the closest laundry room is. It might be on your floor, in your dorm, or in a dorm close by.
2. Pack up your laundry, detergent, dryer sheets, and buzzcard and head to the laundry room.
3. Pick out a washing machine and note the number.
4. To pay for the machine, enter the washing machine number into the card reader on the wall and swipe your buzzcard to pay. The money for this comes from Buzzfunds.
5. Load your laundry in the machine.
6. Put in your detergent. If you use liquid detergent, this goes in the drawer on the front of the machine. Most liquid detergents have a cap that you can use to measure out the right amount. If you use pods, they go right in the drum with your clothes.
7. Select your settings. Cold water will keep your colors from running (and all your stuff from ending up the same color), but doesn't mix with the soap as well.
8. Let it go. The laundry bin will lock until the cycle is done (35 minutes), but after that anyone can get in and move your clothes.
9. Next pick out a dryer and note the number. Use the same card reader to enter the number and pay for it. For most loads, $1.25 will get it dry, but sometimes it needs more time.
10. Load your clothes into the dryer.
11. Use the buttons on the front of the dryer to add time. Keep pushing the "add time" button until it won't add more.
12. Add your dryer sheet (for a nice smell and also to keep static out) if you use them.
13. Choose your heat setting and shut the door. The dryer will also stay locked until it's out of time but automatically unlocks when done.

Freshmen are allowed to bring cars to campus. A parking pass for the year is
$795! You might end up with a parking spot accross campus if you're unlucky. If
you don’t bring your car it’s not going to damage your social life or anything.
There is a bus that goes to Atlantic Station on the weekends. Publix and the
Mini Walmart are within walking distance but the Trolley also goes to them. You
will inevitably meet someone with a car, so you can probably get a ride if you
need it. Just remember Uber and Zipcar (if you sign up for it) are there too.

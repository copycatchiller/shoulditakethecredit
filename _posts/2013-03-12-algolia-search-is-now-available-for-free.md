Yes, you read that right! We're not talking about a free trial, but of a
completely FREE version of our SDK. It is often difficult to implement a good
search experience, so we want to democratize access to easy-to-integrate and
first class search features! All you have to do is to display non-intrusive
Algolia branding.

This branded offer is already available on our website. Don't delay, [register
today][1]! Check out our [use-cases
section][2] to discover possible
implementations and see how Sharypic, Offline dictionaries, and Sush.io have
integrated Algolia in their apps.

Help us spread the word. We want every app developer to be able to take
advantage of this offer!

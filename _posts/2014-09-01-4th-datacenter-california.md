Do you know the 3 most important things in search? Speed, speed, and speed!

At Algolia, we work at making access to content and information completely
seamless. And that can only be done if search results are returned so fast
that they seem instant.

That means two things for us: getting server **response time under 10ms**
(checked), and getting the servers close to end-users to lower latency.

We are on a quest to make search faster than 100ms from anywhere in the world,
and today is an important step. We are thrilled to announce the **opening of
our 4th datacenter, located in California**!

You can now choose to be hosted on this datacenter when [signing
up](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up) (multi-datacenter distribution is
also available for enterprise users).

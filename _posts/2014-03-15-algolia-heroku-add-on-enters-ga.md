We launched the first beta of our Heroku add-on in October 2013 and are now
happy to announce its general availability!

During the beta period we received excellent feedback (and some bug reports!)
that helped us improve our integration. We are now fully ready to serve
production on both Heroku datacenters. If you were part of our beta program,
we will contact you shortly to invite you to migrate to a standard plan.

You can directly install it from our [Heroku add-on
page][1] and as ever, please [let us
know][2] if you have any feedback!

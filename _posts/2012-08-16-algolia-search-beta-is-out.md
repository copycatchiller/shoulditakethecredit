[![][1]](https://blog.algolia.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/08/searchForEvernoteSmall.png)After a few months in the
making, our first mobile library is finally ready to hit the shelves! Well,
nearly! Before releasing it, we want all the feedback you can give us to
ensure it's bug-free, easy to use and responsive to your needs.

If you subscribed to the beta, you should already have received your access
info. If not, you can request it directly on www.algolia.com.

You'll be able to download both the iOS and the Android versions, along with
all necessary documentation. Feel free to ask for any clarification or
additional info. We'll do a few technical posts which explore the product
internals in the coming months.

We're now eager to read your feedback! You just have one address to remember
to report bugs, request features, or anything beta related: beta@algolia.com

Enjoy!

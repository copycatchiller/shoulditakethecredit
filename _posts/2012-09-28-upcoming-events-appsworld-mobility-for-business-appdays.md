With the summer behind us, the period is pretty active. It's really difficult
to attend all the great events, big and small, organized out there. After
[Mobile Monday][1],
[Failcon][2] and the first meeting of
[Appsterdam][3] Paris this week, here are the major mobile
app conferences we're attending in the next few weeks!

  * [Appsworld][4], the 2nd and 3rd of October in London. It's a major event attended by lot of mobile industry professionals. There are expecting up to 5000 participants!
  * [Mobility for business][5], the 11th and 12th of October in Paris. A big event too, they are expecting about 3000 attendees!
  * [Appdays][6], the 9th of November in Paris. A more human sized event (200 participants) and definitely a place to be!

If you happen to participate to one of these, get in touch for some passionate
discussion around mobile apps development!

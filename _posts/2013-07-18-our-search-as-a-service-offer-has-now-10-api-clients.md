We recently reached a new milestone towards the release of our Search as a
Service offer. We're now proud to offer 10 API clients, covering all major
languages.

Ease of use was a major focus during development. We began by offering a
complete and easy-to-integrate [REST API][1].
Providing API clients was a logical way to improve ease of use. You can now
quick start and test the engine with your data in a couple of minutes, with no
prior configuration whatsoever. Each API Client is released under the MIT
License and comes with a quick start and complete documentation:

  * [Javascript client][2]
  * [Ruby client][3]
  * [Python client][4]
  * [PHP client][5]
  * [iOS and OS X client][6]
  * [Android client][7]
  * [Java client][8]
  * [C# client for Windows, Windows Phone and Silverlight][9]
  * [Node.js client][10]
  * [Command line client for linux/mac][11]

This variety of languages and platforms reveals the diversity of our beta
testers:

  * Customer size: from a small startup developing their MVP, to a big social network searching in their 130M+ users.
  * Volume: from a few queries to tens of millions per day. 
  * Technical environments: mobile, desktop, and web apps.

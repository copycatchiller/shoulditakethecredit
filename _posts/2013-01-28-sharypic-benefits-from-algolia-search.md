Demonstrating how Algolia Search functions in the wild, in this post we will
discuss a recent integration with [sharypic][1], another
Paris-based startup focussed on photo sharing at events.

Sharypic is a [web][2] and [mobile
app][3] dedicated to collaborative photo sharing, focused on
enabling users to easily gather photos from attendees during and after an
event. The platform allows users to collect and share photos from all devices,
including mobiles (via Twitter and Instagram), cameras, and computers, and
from already existing albums on Facebook, Picassa, and Flickr. One of their
killer features is the ability to stream photos to a live PhotoWall at the
venue and to an embeddable slideshow widget. This increases engagement both
with event attendees and with an online audience. On sharypic one of the
primary ways that users discover events is via a search bar, in addition to
pages highlighting recent and popular events.

  
[![Sharypic][4]](http://blog.algolia.com/sharypic-benefits-
from-algolia-search/sharypic/)The existing mobile search function relied on
users accurately typing an event's name into the search field, which limited
the results (especially on smartphones where typos are common). By integrating
Algolia Search into the mobile app, sharypic users can now type just a few
letters of a search term, or enter it incorrectly ('pqris' instead of
'Paris'), and the results will display the corrected term within event names,
locations, descriptions, or hashtags.

Martin Fourcade, one of sharypic's co-founders, said "For our users, it's
exactly what we needed. They can show the best photos of their events to
friends without bugging their smartphone and whining about the internet
connection. I'm lazy when it comes to typing on my smartphone, impatient when
it comes to waiting for server responses... now everything is done with a few
keystrokes!"

Sharypic's other co-founder François-Joseph Grimault hopes that this new
intelligent search will enable users to find specific content more easily,
possibly leading to increased exploration on the platform. Time will tell how
the new search feature affects user behaviour, but reducing user frustration
through quick and efficient search is a step in the right direction.

_[Download][5] the latest version of the sharypic app, including

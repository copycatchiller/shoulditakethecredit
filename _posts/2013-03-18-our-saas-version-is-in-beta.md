Imagine all the power and simplicity of Algolia Search, but available online,
from any connected device. Welcome to our Cloud!

Up to now, our instant, typo-friendly search was only available locally on
your device. You could only index data stored directly in your app. While that
was great for offline apps, it was not so fantastic for rapidly changing data
server-side. All that has just changed! You can now use our search engine
online, enabling you to change your data at any frequency and return
consistantly up-to-date search results in your apps. Interested? Request your
invitation to the Beta from the [features
page][1].

And don't forget you can combine it with our offline SDK, for great search
performance whatever the connectivity!

After going back and forth a few times with Apple, we are really happy to
announce the availibility of our [Smart
Contacts][1]
application on the App Store! Even if we built it to demonstrate the amazing
features of our search technology SDK, it can be used as an in-place
replacement of the traditional iPhone Contacts app. Check it up!

## Outstanding Search Features

It plugs directly intoÂ your iPhone contacts and classically allows you to
update them or create new ones. What's more interesting is the Search
integration! It features:[![Smart Contacts Screenshot][3]](https://blog.algolia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12

  * **Instant search** with autocompletion and **visual feedback** as you type
  * Search on **all contacts attributes** (name, company, notes, etc.)
  * **Typo tolerance** to account for smartphone small keyboards
  * And even **search by initials**!

## iOS API Limitations

There are a few of features we would have loved to integrate that were not
possible due to limitations in iOS APIs: group management, in place
replacement of contacts in the phone app (that's maybe a lot to ask!), and
ranking based on contact popularity.

## Free your Imagination!

If you ever wanted to see Algolia Search in action, now is the time. Check it
up with your own data and imagine what Algolia can do for the application you
develop!

And don't forget your 5 stars ranking ;)

You mint already be familiar with Evernote. It's a great company that delivers
an impressive product that I use often, both professionally and personally.
When we heard about them organizing their second developer competition, we
immediately thought about the fantastic opportunity it could be for Algolia!

Let's sum up:

  * It's an excellent use case for our first lib: search in Evernote mobile apps is quite awful and we could really bring a better user experience!
  * It's a good incentive to create a second demo (after Cities Suggest) that's more convincing, especially for Evernote's users.
  * It's an opportunity to get some media coverage :)
  * And most of all it's an excellent occasion to pitch our lib to the Evernote team. We would love to have them as an happy customer!

As you see, even if we don't make it to the finals, the decision was a no-
brainer! But, wait... we'd love to go to the finals! **And you can help us!**
Part of the competition is to get the maximum public support. You want to hep
us? Just go to our [submission
page][1] and
vote once a day! Tell your friends! Tell your grandma! You can even log in via

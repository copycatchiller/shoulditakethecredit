We [launched the private beta][1] of our Search-as-a-Service offer two months ago. In that time we
received very positive feedback from our beta testers and we couldn't thank
them enough for the help they provided. To date, they have sent over 1M
indexation jobs and over 5M queries, and the trend is increasing.

Today we are happy to continue simplifying the experience with the release of
six API Clients under the MIT license:

  * [Command line client for linux/mac][2]
  * [Ruby client][3]
  * [Python client][4]
  * [PHP client][5]
  * [Javascript client][6]
  * [Node.js client][7]

Ease of integration just improved again! Your feedback (and pull requests) is
most welcome.

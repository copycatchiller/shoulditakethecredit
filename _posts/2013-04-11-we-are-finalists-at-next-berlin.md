[![NEXT Berlin Finalists][1]](http://nextberlin.eu/2013/04/next13-start-up-pitch-these-are-
the-12-finalists/)The [NEXT Berlin Conference][2] will
take place on April 23rd & 24th in one of the most active entrepreneurial
ecosystems in Europe!  More than 100 experts will share their knowledge with
an expected audience of 2000 attendees.

If you follow our newsletter or social presence, chances are you saw our call
for help to participate in the NEXT Berlin startup competition. We sincerely
thank you for your votes! They placed us in the 30 top startups to be
considered for the final. The judges then selected us as one of the [12
finalists][3] to pitch during the conference. We are thrilled to be able
to present Algolia to Berlin!

If you happen to be attending NEXT Berlin, ping me if you'd like to meet!

[![Now introducing Algolia Search][1]](https://blog.algolia.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/11/hand.jpg)After 4 betas and muchÂ priceless feedback, we
are really excited to announce the release of Algolia Search! We launched it
Monday during the 60th edition of [Mobile Monday Paris](http://algolia.us5
.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=4cb821b85eca457f3c8a4df2f&id=c46402f441&e=df9a
44f8b5)! If you don't know what Algolia Search can do for your app, take a
look at its [amazing features][2] or just watch
the [video][3]!

This release also means that you can now integrate it directly into your apps
and publish them! We wanted to have a simple and clear pricing plan: You can
have all the benefits of Algolia Search in one Android or iOS App for only
$590! Think about it, that's less than the day-rate of a mobile developer in
many countries. Compare it to the many days you would need to integrate SQL
Lite FTS for poor features.

[Try Algolia Search for free][4] for 30-days!

We are also very excited to introduce our new
[website][5] alongside this launch. You'll be able to
access up-to-date documentation easily, to [try and
download][6] Algolia Search in a few clicks and, of
course, to order the product! Check it out and let us know what you think!

Thanks again to our beloved beta testers. Stay tuned for more news!

One of the worst user experiences I have ever had with software was with the
Sony PS3. I kind of liked this product; I found the user interface very nice
and well organized... but they were much too aggressive about upgrades! They
simply blocked features until the upgrade was done!

A few weeks ago I wanted to watch a VOD movie with my wife. I launched the
Playstation Store that asked me to upgrade the OS to the latest version.
That's **45 minutes** before being able to access the Playstation again! But
wait! Once the new OS was installed, I tried to launch  the Playstation Store
again... This time, it was the Playstation Application that was not up to date
!

In total it took me over **1 hour** to do upgrades and guess what, at the end
it was just too late to watch the movie!

Generally, frequent upgrades are good for your users, and I am sure there are
plenty of bug fixes/improvments in the lastest version. But Sony has just made
the wrong choice in blocking features until the upgrade is done. This is just
plain frustrating for users! On the contrary, Android and iOS propose an
upgrade that you can apply when you want. Best of all, they download in the
background.

It may sound evident, but it is very important to ensure your users will
always be able able to keep control over their products. You should never
force them to do something they do not want to, like Sony did with the PS3.
